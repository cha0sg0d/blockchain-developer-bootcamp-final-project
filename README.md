### Description
With the increasing effectiveness of L2 solutions for Ethereum, it is likely that on-chain voting will occur more often.

The current most popular voting solution, Snapshot, does not have voting on chain.
I have created Starshot, a simple Dapp for on-chain voting.

### Admin flow
*Note: must be owner of contract*
1. Create a proposal and list the options that can be voted on

### User flow
1. Login with Metamask
2. Vote for one option for the specified proposal.

### Video Demo
